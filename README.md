A concise EDA of an online retail dataset exploring sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. Key insights were generated through feature engineering and 12 visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, supporting decisions in customer segmentation, inventory planning, and demand analysis.
This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an online retail dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and sales trends across various time dimensions. After performing systematic data cleaning and feature engineering, key metrics such as revenue, customer frequency, monetary value, and invoice totals were derived. These metrics were analyzed through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques to uncover patterns and insights essential for business decision-making.

Using statistical summaries and twelve well-designed visualizations created through Matplotlib and Seaborn, the analysis highlights clear trends such as weekday sales dominance, peak purchasing hours, strong year-end seasonality, and the disproportionate revenue contributions of a small group of high-demand products. Customer-level segmentation further reveals distinct spending behaviors, helping identify high-value and loyal customer groups.

Overall, this project transforms raw transactional data into meaningful insights that can guide strategic actions in customer engagement, inventory planning, marketing optimization, and demand forecasting. The findings demonstrate how data analytics can offer valuable support for business growth and operational efficiency.
